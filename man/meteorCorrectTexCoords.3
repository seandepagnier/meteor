.SH NAME
meteorMerge
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <meteor.h>
.sp
.BI "void meteorCorrectTexCoords(void)"
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the meteor does not contain texture data no operation is performed.

Attempt to correct wrapping in texture coordinates.  The algorithm
will insert points and triangles into the meteor in places where points
have texture coordinates that would span a large distances.  For example
if points with texture coordinates of .1 and .9 are bound by an edge,
then the algorithm will insert two new points at the same position between
these points.  The new points will have texture coordinates 0, and 1, and
will be attached to .1 and .9 respectively.  This operation is performed
for each dimension.  The algorithm has more accurate results if a function
is supplied to \fBmeteorTexCoordFunc\fP.
