Meteor - mesh generation and manipulation tool and library

Inspired by the desire to generate triangle representations of
interstellar objects in various levels of detail.

Written by Sean D'Epagnier (sean@depagnier.com)

The main features of the library are:
1. Mesh generation -- Uses equations of the form f(x, y, z) = 0
2. Quadric pair contraction -- Reduce triangle and point count.
3. Aggregation -- Merge nearby sections of the mesh together
4. Clipping -- Removal of all data on one side of an equation
5. Duplication of points -- Correction for texture coordinates
6. IO routines -- can save and load in various formats (can convert
data from one format to another)

There exist simplified demo programs that demonstrate the usage
of the library.

The command-line app meteor provides an interface to all of the above
operations, as well as:

1. accept equations, source files with functions, or data files.
2. write output to data files 
3. display the mesh (requires opengl and glut)
4. animate meshes (can be based on a 4th variable)
5. take screenshots and generate video files (with required libraries)

For information on how to invoke meteor, consult the man page

This program uses glut for maximum portability, it is designed to work well
with the linux-fbdev opengl mesa driver and its glut implementation.

To generate documentation in html format with man2html installed invoke
"make man2html" in the man directory and check the subdirectory html.

See COPYING for license details.
See INSTALL for compiling instructions.

There are many more possible features of this program in the future, I just
haven't had time to implement them, feel free to make requests.

bug reports, feature requests, and patches should be sent to sean@depagnier.com
