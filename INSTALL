Quickstart:

run ./configure; make; make install

===========

Most features are autodetected an displayed after running ./configure

The --with-float-format option lets you select float, double, or long double
for the internal format for the mesh operations.

double is the default as it is not typically slower than float, uses a little
more memory, but has much better precision.  For some algorithms such as
quadric merging, floats do not provide adequate accuracy.

===========

For debugging support configure with --enable-debug and --disable-shared

===========

A good way to get information about all the configuration options is
./configure --help 

===========

The simplest way to verify succes after install is by running
meteor -nvez
